Important steps:
================

Make sure that there is no previous installation of MacFUSE exists in the 
system. Run,

  bash# sudo /Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Support/uninstall-macfuse-core.sh

After this, install MacFUSE (mostly through .dmg available in macfuse homepage 
or if Gluster Inc provides any custom built .dmg)

Make sure the .dmg of glusterfs is built against the installed MacFUSE version
(if not, any operations over mountpoint gives EIO ie, Input/Output Error). If 
glusterfs tarball is used then compile it only after the MacFUSE installation 
is complete.

To make an entry in /etc/fstab for glusterfs mount, use 'vifs' command

   bash# sudo vifs

after the entry is added in /etc/fstab, it can be mounted by 'mount' command.

To start the server process one can use the 'launchd' mechanism. Follow below 
steps after installation

   bash# launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.gluster.glusterfs.plist
   
No need to run the command if the machine reboots, as it will be loaded 
automatically by launchd process.

Now copy the server volume file in the proper path

   bash# sudo vi /opt/local/etc/glusterfs/server.vol

NOTE: (If glusterfs is installed in different path other than '/opt/local' 
      update the volume file at the corresponding  path, and  also need to 
      update the /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.gluster.glusterfs.plist with 
      the proper path)

Once the volume file is updated, administrator can start the server process by
running,

  bash# launchctl start com.gluster.glusterfs

and stop like

  bash# launchctl stop com.gluster.glusterfs

NOTE: To start the process by default when the loaded, one need to add the 
following lines to .plist file
      -----
      <key>KeepAlive</key> 
      <true/>
      -----




Install using .dmg in Terminal
=================================

  bash# hdiutil attach <package>.dmg
  bash# cd /Volumes/<package>/
  bash# installer -pkg <package>.pkg -installer /
  bash# cd 
  bash# hdiutil detach /Volumes/<package>/
