/* GLFS OBJECT BASED OPERATIONS
 *
 * The following APIs are introduced to provide an API framework that can work
 * with gluster objects (files and directories), instead of absolute paths.
 *
 * The following API set can be related to the POSIX *at interfaces (like
 * openat (2)). The intention of these APIs is to be able to operate based
 * on parent object and looking up or creating child objects within, OR to be
 * used on the actual object thus looked up or created, and retrieve information
 * regarding the same.
 *
 * The APIs also provide for generating an opaque invariant handle to the
 * object, that can later be used to lookup the object, instead of the regular
 * glfs_h_* variants. The APIs that provide this behaviour are,
 * glfs_h_extract_handle and glfs_h_create_from_handle.
 *
 * The object handles can be transitioned to fd based operations as supported
 * by glfs.h calls, using the glfs_h_open call. This provides a way to move
 * from objects to fd's akin to moving from path to fd for required operations.
 *
 * NOTE: The opaque invariant handle is the GFID of the object in reality, but
 * maintained as an opaque data value, for potential internal changes to the
 * same without impacting the caller.
 *
 * NOTE: Currently looking up an object can create multiple object handles to
 * the same, i.e distinct glfs_object *. Hence each such looked up or received
 * handle from other calls, would need to be closed. In the future, for a given
 * object these pointers would be the same, and an ease of use API to forget all
 * instances of this bject would be provided (instead of a per lookup close).
 * This should not change the APIs in their current form.
 *
